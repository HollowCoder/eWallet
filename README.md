# eWallet
## <-----Python 2.7 is required in order to run this project. ------>
#### eWallet is a software under construction which serves the need of users who want to view their bills all in one place and have the ability to pay their bills using whatever card they want. Our system will have an initial part where the new user will first have to enter their card number and name that is on the card in order to proceed in successfully creating an count (so that it will reduce redundancy and will not allow the users who does not have a card to continue). Users can add as many cards as they like (by entering all the necessary card info) and pay their bills whenever. They can pay by either credit or debit. They will be able to create their settings in a way they can receive notifications as to when a bill is due, or they can setup the auto pay option. In order to pay the user’s bill we will accept their money (whatever the amount that is needed to paying the bill) and then deposit it into an anonymous card. Then using that anonymous card pay the customer’s bill. The user will also be able to view their paid bills. There will be another option where if the user does not currently have the money to pay of the bill we can pay it for them but have an interest free added to the specific user per week or per month.
### Our product solves 3 different problems:
